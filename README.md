# K.I.W.I. Automatic Crate Manager
Python script that automatically opens new crates for you and avoids you missclicking on wrong buttons that make you spend BattlePoints for no reason (which is the main reason this script was designed for).

# How
I will not explain how to install python and how to configure the enviroment. There isn't much to say about the script, just run, login and leave it running.
